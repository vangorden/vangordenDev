I'm passionate about finding creative solutions to tough problems, writing clean code, and building innovative tools for the world to enjoy. When I'm not busy utilizing my skill set, I'm building upon it.

While I'm fortunate that my career and interests align, I'm also aware that all things need balance. When I'm away from "work", I enjoy spending my time exploring new hiking trails, traveling the world, tending to my garden, and renovating my home.

I currently reside in beautiful Tucson, Arizona where I'm working on completing my degree in Computer Science at the University of Arizona.
